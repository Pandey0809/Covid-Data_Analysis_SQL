# Covid-19 Data Analysis

This repository contains data analysis done on Covid-19 data set which is available at the following URL https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

## Getting Started

To run this repository, follow these steps:

1. Install DBeaver
2. Upload both CSS files i.e. CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations to DBeaver
3. Change the separator and select null for empty values.

## Analysis

The analysis includes multiple SQL commands which range from trivial to hard.
These commands include the use of `SELECT` statement with `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and `GROUP BY` clauses.
The use of aggregate functions, window functions, "WITH" statement and temporary table are also demonstrated.

At the end, a view has been created to store data for visual analysis.
